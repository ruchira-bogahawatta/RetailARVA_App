## Configuration

Create a **`config.json`** file inside the **`Assets/Resources folder`**. This file stores the necessary API keys for the app to communicate with cloud services.

```
{
  "APIKeys": {
    "SttAPIKey": "ENTER_API_KEY_HERE"
  }
}
```
Make sure to replace "ENTER_API_KEY_HERE" with the actual API key for the Speech-to-Text (STT) service.
